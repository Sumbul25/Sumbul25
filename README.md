### 🚀 About Me

I'm a self-motivated learner with a passion for building user-friendly and impactful digital experiences. 
I love coding not just as a skill, but as a way to **solve real problems** and bring my creativity to life.
Whether it's building a real-time web app, deploying cloud-based systems,
or writing clean frontend code — I'm always excited to learn and grow! 🌱

Apart from coding, I enjoy:
- 🍳 Cooking (and experimenting with recipes!)
- 🎤 Singing (music is my soul language)
- 🎧 Listening to music while I code
- 📖 Reading Shayari that speaks to the heart 💕
